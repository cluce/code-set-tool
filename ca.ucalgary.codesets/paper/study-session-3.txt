Question 1:
p6 - "this is useless"
misunderstood the question

were including assertTrue in the method, which had nothing to do with the question
Once the figured out that the question didn't have anything to do with assertTrue

think that the calls to/from is counter intuative... 

think that it's references From this to here...


question 2:

searched for assertEquals
searched for assertTrue

expect that when searching for something, that the references to and from are added for every
set.

opened annotationTest with eclipse open type
cleared everything
searched for assertEquals
opened AnnotationTest

want the search to open the method in the JavaEditor 

suggestion: "want to click on the check box"


question 3:

they would have had the answer, but they clicked on too many things, and the set that they 
needed was removed from the list. So they had to start all over again

"we lost our run in the references to thing" p6


Question 4:
couldn't get anything for Question 4:



interview:
p5 - "i think i found the ref from and ref to very confusing"

p5 - "i like this idea of like finding subsets through your tool, that how i visualize"

p6 - "i like how you can approach the problem from two sides"

p6 didn't like how things would disappear, and if they were clicked and you were searching for
things then you woulnd't be able to "search" for things.

p5 - "I didn't like how we had to like search for a thing click on it, then click another thing to
	find a reference to be able to open the declaration, being able to open the declaration quicker
	would be good"

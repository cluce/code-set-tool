Study 2

Question 1
"Are we looking for method B"
p3 "search for invoke, i'm thinking"
p3 "then if we search for signatures"
	tried to do the intersection b/w the searches

Confused between ref to / ref from
p3 "I'm def.. lost in what we're trying to do"
needed a little help figuring out how to get to the ref to/ ref from up
p3 "we want ref from invoke and ref to signatures" 
no questions after the first question



Tried clicking on the square in the All Sets view
Question 2

wanted to be able to search for classes


searched for assertEquals
searched for assertTrue


combined the assertEquals and assertTrue searches, and found the ones that were in 
AnnotationTest class, and asked if those are the ones they wanted.
They then added the annotationtest class to the filter and found the 3 methods 
that we were looking for.



found the second question less difficult 
Question 3

searched for assertFalse
searched for assertEquals
searched for run found a lot of results for run

combined the search sets from assertFalse and run,excluded the search for assertEquals,
then intersected it with the AnnotationTest class and found the results

Not how we were looking to do it, but one way of doing it.

Question 4


*very confused about what they were supposed to do for this question*


Comments in the interview
p4 " trying to find who calls what and who does it call"
p3 " i definetely liked seeing the references to a method, because a lot of time 
you might be trying to work on a program that makes calls all over the place 
to one particular method, and found it quite handy"

p3"i don't think i found anything irrelevant, i could def find uses for it"
p4 "nothing irrelevant"
p4 "nothing glaringly handy"
p3 "trying to click on the check box"

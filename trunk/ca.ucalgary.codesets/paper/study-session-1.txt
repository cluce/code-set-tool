session one consisted of 2 participants.  P1 and P2 were both undergraduate males.  

After first reading question one, P1 suggested that they first start by searching for invoke.  They opened the results
of the search and found the invoke(Object) method.  They then attempted to double click on the TheoryMethod class title,
which failed.  P2 after a few attempts, attempted to double click on invoke(Object) method in the CombinedSet, which opened
invoke(Object) in the editor.  P1 noted a bit of confusion as to what referencesFrom actually ment.  The meanings of both
references from and references to was reexplained to the participants.  The participants then continued to open the 
references from invoke(Object).  The participants found a method signatures() in the combinedSet view, and decided to look
at it to figure out what it was.  After examining the method, they decided to return to the Theories.java class. The
participants then discussed what they were looking for.  P1 suggested that they search for signatures, noting that they 
want the references from.  P1 noted that they wanted to open the search results, but that the box doesn't do anything.
P2 attempted to put the sets together, combining references from invoke(Object) and references to signatures(), but quickly noted that couldn't be 
correct as the sets was empty.  They then attempted to try to do the inverse, but acknowledged that was also incorrect.
P1 asked if that was the correct method.  They both quickly noticed the the method had the wrong signature.  They deselected
all the sets and attempted to correct it.  They went back to the signatures search, found the signatures(Method) block, and 
went to it.  They then selected references to signatures(Method) and references from invoke(Object).  After checking with 
the researchers, they had found the set they were looking for.

Describe study questions for paper (has to be very clear)

Question 1
The first question that we used for the study was this: "Method (a) invoke(Object test) in the TheoryMethod 
class, calls a method (b) which calls method (c) signatures(Method method) in the ParameterSignature 
class. What is that method?" This question was an easy question that would let the users start to get used
to using this new tool.  The question 

Answer
Code Perspective	
		The answer to this is that method (a) invoke(Object test) calls method (b) signatures()
		which calls method (c) signatures(Method method).
					
Tool Perspective
		To do this using the tool the user would follow these steps. First search for invoke(Object which 
		bring up a search result with 3 enitites. They would then click on the invoke search so that it showed
		the entities in the Combined Set view. Next, they would click on invoke(Object) which is under the 
		TheoryMethod class. This would show it in the JavaEditor, and add three more sets to the All Sets view; A 
		references from, to, and add the members of type for the TheoryMethod class. After this, the user would 
		deselect the invoke search, and search for signatures(Method. This adds another set to the search results. They
		then select the set, which shows the entites in the Combined Set view. It only has one entity in it, so 
		they double click on that, which brings that up that method in the JavaEditor. This has now added two more sets
		to the All Sets view; a reference from set, and memebers of type for the ParameterSignature class. Now, 
		they deselect the search for the signatures method, and select the reference from invoke(Object) and the 
		references to signatures(Method) which gives a resulting set of one method: signatures() in the Function class.

			
Question 2

Question 3

Find all methods from the AnnotationTest class which call assertFalse(boolean), and also calls 
run(Class<?>... classes), but do not call assertEquals(Object, Object).

Question 4

When running the tests in AssertTest, Assert.assertTrue(boolean) and Assert.assertFalse(Boolean) are
 both executed. What is different about how they are reached during that execution?

 oh and you should include the "answer" as well. the answer should have two perspectives one 
 from a code perspective (this calls that, etc) and the other from a tool perspective
  (click on this and then that and the tool will show ...)
